This mod was originally written by @jimj316, forked and updated by @Senshi, further updated by @Gribbleshnibit8, and finally by myself.

I've integrated both toolbars and a simple config file.

 
From the original posting:

A while ago I saw a request in the suggestions forum that was asking for a way to have the game generate ship names for the player. I realised that I'm always having trouble deciding on names, so I made this little plugin to help. Simply click the little button on the toolbar marked "CB" to open the menu, and poll the KSC workers what they think the ship would be named (please note, you may have to undergo some "workforce restructuring" before you get good suggestions).

This plugin will use either blizzy78's ToolBar plugin, or the stock toolbar.

There is a small config file:  ChampagneBottle.cfg, where you can specify whether to use the Blizzy toolbar or not.  If Blizzy is not available, then it will use the stock toolbar.
